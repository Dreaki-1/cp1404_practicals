## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I changed the way I saw these practicals personally. In CP1401 I found these quite annoying as they were weekly task. I now realise when doing the Assignments the Pracs and Quizzes help alot.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

The biggest thing for my approach that needs adjusting is my attitude, I'm very motivated and enjoy this subject but seem to procrastinate alot. Especially when im flat out at work and have to study after. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I find my overall work ethic and ability to absorb knowledge is what's going well for me

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to complete my Lectures, Pracs and Quizzes earlier in the week

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Nothing really I enjoy my lecturer( Lindsay ) and find his teachings rather clear.
